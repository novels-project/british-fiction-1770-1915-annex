# Ancillary bibliographic records related to *Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles*

The file `british-fiction-1770-1915-riddell.json` contains minimal
bibliographic records of novels published in the British Isles between 1770 and
1915 for which there is (not yet) a canonical source of bibliographic
information (such as a printed bibliography with unique identifier).

It also contains a handful of bibliographic records for novels that do have a
listing in a canonical source when that source is not yet available in
machine-readable form.

It is hoped that *this dataset will become obsolete* as bibliographic databases
available to the public grow more complete.

The data format used is UTF-8 encoded JSON. Corrections are welcome.
